##1. The Background ##
In 1936 Robert Fisher published a paper _The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis_ [1] introducing the now famous Iris Data Set. This data set comprises the width and length measurements of the sepals and petals of three different Iris varieties. 50 samples of each variety were collected on the same day, by the same person (Anderson) and measured using the same instruments. 

The resultant dataset comprised of 150 records each containing 5 no attributes - each of the petal and sepal measurements and also the variety of Iris the measurements related to. This dataset is widely used as a reference for Data Analytics amd Machine Learning.

###1.1 The Project Brief ###
The following project concerns the well-known Fisher’s Iris data set. The project entails you researching the data set, and then writing documentation and code in the Python programming language based on that research.

##2. Initial Exploration##
Initial exploration of the dataset 

##3. Plotting of the Data##

###3.1 Boxplots ###
<img align="right" src="images/box-plot-explained.gif">
A boxplot or box and whisker plot is a graphical representation of data whereby a rectangle is drawn around the middle two quartiles of the data. The median, the point at which 50% of values are higher and 50% of values are lower, is represented in the rectangle or box. The whiskers extend out of the box to represent the maximum and minimum values of the data with the exclusion of outliers. For this purpose the outlier is defined as any value outside 3/2 times the upper / lower quartile. Essentially, it give a good overview of the data's distribution. [2]
